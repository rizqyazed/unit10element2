            On the 5th of April 2008, Joseph Delappe started a 240-mile journey
            that spanned across 22 days (in real life) in the game Second Life.
            Using his Gandhi avatar, DeLappe used a treadmill to control his
            character to reenact Mahatma Gandhi's “Salt March to Dandi” - a
            protest against the Brisitsh Salt Act of 1882. Delappe took this
            further by aligning the performance with the original dates of the
            protest back in 1930. His work resonates with my practice as a
            whole, as my works frequently attempt to question the physicality of
            being on the internet. For example, in
            <a href="https://www.rizqyazed.xyz/letsinstallanexhibition"
              >Let's install an Exhibition (2024)</a
            >, a site-specific installation and performance that took place on
            Google Maps, acknowledges the evident abstract border of URL and
            IRL. The installation explores the in-between states of the
            legitimacy of labour online compared to physical labour, as we
            invest more time and emotional energy into it. This invites the
            viewer to reflect on the labour, even if it is through a digital
            lens, similar to how DeLappe questions the legitimacy of the online
            protest despite the physical labour.

            Alessandro Sambini’s “People at an Exhibition” is a web-based
            project that lives on YouTube and as a physical performance. The
            work consists of a robot that films several people as they enter a
            room with a green background. The recording is then uploaded to a
            YouTube channel titled People At An Exhibition as stock footage.
            From this perspective, “People at an Exhibition” faces through the
            exploration of self-copyrighting and exploitation online. These
            videos, much like the live-stream and Instagram post of
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_b4n_gaunt4_/">@_b4n_g4unt_</a>,
            are the likeness of the subjects, which were mediated by the artist.
            This questions the owner of the work - an interesting point brought
            to by one of my tutors during a crit session. To an extent, I
            believe that the work belongs to the artist as they are the driving
            force of the project, and the visitors are the subject, much like a
            film director and the actors

            Being the first ever performance piece I’ve done, especially as
            straining as this work, was a new experience for me. It got me
            thinking about the nature of the performance and how it would affect
            my perception of the person I'm following. Since we are both close
            friends, questions started to dawn on me. How would this experience
            affect my view of him? Am I using my friend? Is this too much of an
            invasion of privacy? This is where the works of Sophie Calle come
            in. Her performance works show an intimate insight into the act of
            following, while also revealing the exploitative nature of the
            works. Calle’s work, Suite Vénitienne, is a collection of
            photographs and text detailing her fixation upon a man named “Henry
            B”. Secretly over two weeks, Henry was followed by Calle. His
            day-to-day actions are analysed and recorded. Through these actions,
            Calle starts to fall in love with Henry. While I wouldn't describe
            myself as having “fallen in love” with
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_b4n_gaunt4_/">@_b4n_g4unt_</a>,
            I do sense a deeper connection with my friend. Although I do agree
            with Calle when she sees the action of stalking and photographing
            Henry as to immortalise the moment and stake a claim on ephemeral
            things. In my case, the live stream acts as an archive of my friend
            - a raw and intimate version of him. What seems to be obsessive
            stalking, Calle’s actions reflect the day-to-day behaviour of online
            stalking. It has a kind of anonymity and detective tactics that
            Calle could only dream of. Like Henry and
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_b4n_gaunt4_/">@_b4n_g4unt_</a>,
            we are all unknowing participants in the intimate quest for
            closeness that Calle yearns to achieve.

            Follower is a website/performance, created by Lauren McCarty, where
            people can sign up for a real-life follower for a day. However, they
            would not know when or how they are being followed during the day.
            At the end of the day, the person will receive an image of
            themselves taken at a random time during the day. This is a public
            performance piece where anyone interested in following someone can
            set it up in the city where they live. This work has a direct
            correlation to my degree show in terms of physicalising the Internet
            experience. Like most social media, we allow users to “follow” our
            lives without any hesitation. McCarthy has perfectly emphasised this
            by giving agency to the participant to make a request for them to be
            followed. We often forget that it is real people whom we interact
            with on the internet. We are clouded by the anonymity of digital
            profiles and usually get away with actions unprecedented in real
            life. This numbness also shows people wanting a more real sense of
            connection, an offline connection. Why else would people sign up to
            be followed? I like how she presented her screenshots in frames.
            Very low-tech. It is exactly what I have been experimenting with,
            especially in the

            last February. By remediating these digitally native images into
            physical form, it opens up for primarily visual inspection, drawing
            attention to aspects of the image that were easily overlooked by
            users. It has been decontextualised, which adds to the elusiveness
            of the subject and follower.

          <p>
            West of the Tracks is a Chinese documentary film by Wang Bing. It is
            a 9-hour-long film that covers the 2 years, from 1999 to 2001,
            displaying the decline of Shenyang’s industrial Tiexi district. I
            was particularly interested in the cinematography of the
            documentary. Its style is raw and unfiltered. The long takes of the
            group of factory workers give us a glimpse of their day-to-day
            lives. Filmed using a mini-DV camera, the cinematography reflects
            the conditions of the industrial district. It is also filmed with a
            fish-eye lens, which creates this dreamlike imagery, distorting
            people's perception of the place. It doesn't look real. With that,
            there are some parallels to my stream. I try to engage with the
            cinematography in a similar way to Bing. The rougher quality from
            the mini DV is mirrored through the use of my iPhone 11 camera with
            an inconsistent sensor. The images are constantly going in and out
            of focus, and there is constant jitteriness within the shots. Like
            the workers,
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_b4n_gaunt4_/">@_b4n_g4unt_</a>
            and his friends do not seem to acknowledge the camera, creating an
            uncomfortable experience for the viewers (and filmmaker). The
            presence of filming is being contradicted by the fact that no one
            acknowledges the camera, which feels like we’re invading their
            space.

          <p>
            The Internet Cache Self-Portrait is a series by the artist Evan
            Roth. The artist compiles a stream of uncensored images, collected
            through daily use of the Internet within the browser’s cache. It
            forms a “uniquely 21st-century self-portrait”, both as a portrait of
            the Internet at that specific moment in time and also a
            “contemporary nude”, exposing the subjects' inherently private
            online interactions. These images are printed out onto rolls of
            vinyl, materialising the data stored. As the audience, we are
            enabled to be intimate and fill in the blanks of what the subject
            could be like, their personality, etc. This work directly inspired
            the addition of printed receipt paper detailing all the users who
            follow
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_b4n_gaunt4_/">@_b4n_g4unt_</a>

            LOWTECH, as defined by fakewhale as “a practice that reframes
            technology not as a symbol of linear progress but as a space for
            questioning and redefining sculptural language” (fakewhale, 2025).
            Having roots from the avant-gardes, such as Duchamp and Moholy-Nagy.
            It was a period when technology was used as a fundamental part of
            the production. However, LOWTECH is within the context where
            technology has become banal and has lost its awe value. This then
            encouraged artists to create work with the subversion of
            contemporary technology and “explore a broader concept of digital
            art, not defined just by its medium” (ibid. ). This aesthetic is
            prevalent in my work, or to be more specific, the way I think of the
            presentation of my work. It lies between the realms of functional
            and dysfunctional tech. Using the technology not as it is intended
            (<a href="https://www.rizqyazed.xyz/foreducationalpurposes"
              >Copeland show</a
            >), or in a context where it is unconventional, such as the gallery
            space, opens up for new perspectives that I could utilise. This
            method of presenting resonates with my practice as it allows for
            deeper intimacy between the work and the audience. The raw and
            brutalist approaches (<a

              >compression artefact #2</a

            feel like allows for a deeper connection between the two.

          <p>
            Marina Abramovic is one of the most prominent artists in performance
            art and thinking deeply/critically about the self. In terms of
            inspiration for my performance, her work was one of the first to
            come to mind, not just with me but with others. Everyone I discussed
            with drew this reference, and I can definitely see why. Abramovic’s
            performance is provoking as it “tested the limits of her own
            physical and mental endurance in her work, subjecting herself to
            exhaustion, pain and even the possibility of death” (Royal Academy
            of Arts, 2023). Despite this, there is still room for reflection on
            identity, gender, and perspectives. Marina Abramovic’s Relation in
            Time stood out to me the most. It represents the … to perform in
            front of an audience. For the performance, Abromovic and Ulay, her
            former partner and collaborator, had their ponytails tied together.
            While it represents the literal intimacy while performing, there
            were points where they couldn't take it anymore. They had then
            invited museum visitors to view them, which allowed them to go
            further. This experience mirrors the one I had during the 24-hour
            livestream, but instead of physical visitors, I had my livestream
            viewers and the live chat. There were times when it was boring (
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_b4n_gaunt4_/">@_b4n_g4unt_</a>
            studying), but seeing people engaging in my performance and the
            subject allowed me to continue.

          <img src="images/9.webp" />
          <p>
            I had doubts about performing initially, pending 24 hours
            (originally 1 week), constantly following and filming my friend. Am
            I wasting my time? People seem not to understand that with Hsieh’s
            work at the time, as “why the artist would ever choose to subject
            himself to such physical and mental extremes, and how 'wasting time'
            could even qualify as art” (Kim, 2017). However, it’s about
            perspective. As Hsieh puts it, “We can talk about suffering, but
            then we have to talk about freedom. Or we can talk about freedom,
            but we also have to talk about discipline. There are many things
            interwoven.”(ibid. ). Hsieh’s art is a homage to everyday life,
            which asks us to meditate on the time we have for ourselves. It's a
            reflection of how we have used our time. This is especially
            important in an increasingly digital age, where technology
            simultaneously frees up our time and distracts us to no end. Hsieh’s
            performances give us that freedom to not be constrained.

            Amalia Ulman’s Excellences & Perfections is a scripted Instagram
            performance. Over 5 months, Ulman adopted a new persona online - an
            extreme makeover. She uses new 21st-century female tropes to explore
            social media’s power to create realities out of fictions. She
            tackles the performative nature of influencers and how an image can
            be a signifier of class, and how cultural capital is reflected in
            selfies. The decision to use Instagram as the medium meant that the
            public could also and did interact through the comments section with
            the artist during the performance. This would directly influence the
            work as it was being performed. It also adds the authenticity of the
            work: the public couldn't distinguish whether it was real or fake.
            Even Ulman’s close friends were confused when separating her
            fictional online persona - it was becoming too real. However,
            presenting this performance was another challenge that I am even
            facing for my degree show work. For something that is inherently
            meant to be consumed on a device/online, how can we emphasise the
            work in the physical space without being mundane? Most of the
            exhibition, including Excellences & Perfections, used large-scale
            prints of Ulman’s selfies and Instagram posts. Maya Man, an artist
            focused on contemporary identity culture on the internet, said,
            encapsulates why I feel fascinated and excited with experimenting
            with presenting work not native to their medium. She argues that the
            internet has a “fluid quality where you can view it in many
            different ways” (Chiou, 2024) and with the decrease in users’
            attention span, remediating these digital artefacts allows them to
            consume and have authority over the audience’s attention.
